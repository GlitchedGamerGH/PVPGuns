This datapack is required to be installed like a regular datapack by going into .minecraft\saves\<world_name>\datapacks or instances\<instance_name>\saves\<world_name>\datapacks <br>
NOTE: this datapack is for 1.20.1 and will not work on 1.21 due to mojang changing the directory names from pluralised ones to singular (ei. Functions->Function) and thus many things will break/not work <be>
